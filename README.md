What is Motocoin?
----------------
 Motocoin is the first Proof-of-Thought crypto-currency. It is similar to
Proof-of-Work but instead of requiring to solve computationally expensive
puzzles on computer it requires human to solve puzzles that are hard for
computer. More specifically, people play 2D moto-simulator game (similar to
Elastomania) on pseudo-randomly generated levels. Each time someone completes
level faster than the target time, new block is generated and that player gets
reward. As more people play and better they play the target becomes lower
and harder to reach.

It has the following advantages:
* No need for expensive mining hardware. To mine it you just need computer
  and some skill at videogames.
* No energy is wasted on useless computations.
* Almost impossible to perform 51% attack. If you control enough hardware
  you can perform 51% attack on a classic proof-of-work crypto-currency,
  machines wouldn't bore to fulfill your evil wishes. But people prefer to
  work for their profit and it would be too expensive to hire enough people,
  especially considering that most skilled players would rather mine Motocoin
  than destroy it.

Other information:
 - 5 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 200k blocks (~2 years) but will never be less than 2 coins per block.
 - â‰ˆ40 mln coins in first 12 years, then 200 000 coins per year
 - 100 coins per block
 - 3.5 days (1008 blocks) to retarget difficulty

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Motocoin client sofware, see http://www.motocoin.org or https://motocoin-dev.github.io/motocoin-site/

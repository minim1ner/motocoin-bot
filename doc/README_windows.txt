Intro
-----
Motocoin is the first Proof-of-Play cryptocurrecncy. It is free open source
peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is completely decentralized, without
the need for a central server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys
to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of a
P2P network to check for double-spending. To get some motocoins you can play
the game called motogame.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run motocoin-qt.exe.

Motocoin-Qt is the original Motocoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Motocoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
